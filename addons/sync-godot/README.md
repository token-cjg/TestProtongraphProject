# Godot plugin
A Godot addon to get the features from ConceptGraph directly in the editor.

This aims to mimic the behavior of the pre 0.6 versions but depends on the runtime to be completed first.

# TODO
- Complete the runtime https://github.com/concept-graph/runtime
- Setup an IPC client to talk with the core
- Display a node graph editor in the engine directly
